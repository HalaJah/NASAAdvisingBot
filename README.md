## NASA Advising Chatbot

I developed a chatbot designed to assist users in choosing the ideal planet for travel. This was achieved by fine-tuning the GPT-3 model using data scraped from Canadian immigration websites containing planetary infographics. I implemented a Python script/tool that initiates scraping each time the chatbot is loaded. However, the fine-tuning process wasn't entirely successful, largely because I didn't use any indexing libraries and relied solely on the data and the prompts given to the model. Despite this, the experience provided valuable insights into the steps required for chatbot development, which I later applied in my HackTX hackathon project.

I intended to participate in the NASA App Challenge, but due to the project's lack of success, I ended up not submitting.
